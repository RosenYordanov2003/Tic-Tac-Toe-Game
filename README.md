#### I've decided to make the popular tic-tac-toe game in C#(.NET Core).
#### The rules are simple:
- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
- You can choose the color of the fild with the colors available on the console, without black and white.
- You can play with your friend or alone vs the computer.
- I used SOLID principles and also I've implemented the Factory pattern to create the properly type of color for the field.
